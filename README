This project is set of patches and scripts to automate bitcoin-qt 
cross-compilation using 64bit mingw (Linux -> Win64).

The following tools must be present in the system to use build.sh:

 - GCC with C++ support ( to build native tools like qmake, lrelease, etc )
 - patch
 - git ( to clone remote repository )
 - zip/unzip

Usage:
	./build.sh [PATH] 
  If PATH parameter is absent the project will be built in current directory.
  Otherwise PATH will be used. IMPORTANT: PATH must be full, not relative.

  In case of successful build resulting archive will be placed to start directory,
  in case of fail more information can be found in log.txt where all build process is logged.
